# Points Cloud Cube Anchoring

Just touch the edge of your room to generate a forward cube. Recalibrate the level you build for the room and save it. Next time you regenerate this cube, the level should be calibrated. Otherwise, you can readjust it.


Same concept as ThreePointsTag, but designed specifically for a room.
Walls cannot be passed through with your hands or controller, so simply touch the wall in all directions. This generates a cube. The point where you start the calibration determines the room's orientation.

This is a good idea for tiny houses, small rooms, and vans. However, for much larger rooms or those with a missing wall, this calibration is not suitable at all.
